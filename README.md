# 🌱 Bloom Level Setting  

## 📌 Overview  
Bloom Level Setting is a **C-based learning platform** designed to assess and enhance cognitive skills using **Bloom’s Taxonomy**. It enables structured evaluation of learning levels, from basic understanding to advanced critical thinking, through **efficient data management and sorting algorithms**.  

## 🚀 Features  
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete bloom level records.  
- **Efficient Sorting & Searching**: Implements **Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Binary Search, and Linear Search** for optimized data retrieval.  
- **File Handling**: Stores and manages data persistently using text files.  
- **Algorithm Analysis**: Evaluates time complexity for performance optimization.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: C  
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, Sorting & Searching Algorithms  
- **File Handling**: Persistent storage of bloom levels
